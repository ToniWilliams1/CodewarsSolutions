/*
Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]


*/

function friend(friends){
//check each friend to see how many letters they have
  // if they have more than 4, then. remove them from the array
  
  return friends.filter(name => name.length ===4 )
  
}
