/*
Your job is to figure out the index of which vowel is missing from a given string:

A has an index of 0,
E has an index of 1,
I has an index of 2,
O has an index of 3,
U has an index of 4.
Notes: There is no need for string validation and every sentence given will contain all vowels but one. Also, you won't need to worry about capitals.
