/*
I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays... Actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

function arrayPlusArray(arr1, arr2) {
  
  let arr = [...arr1, ...arr2]
  return arr.reduce((a,b) => a + b); //something went wrong
}
