/*
Make the double() function return a new array with each value twice as large as the corresponding value in the passed in array. Your solution must use the map() function of the built-in javascript Array object. If you're not familiar with map(), reading over the documentation may help

    // Use array.map() to return a new array with each value twice
    // as large as the corresponding value in the passed in array.
  return array.map(num => num * 2)
