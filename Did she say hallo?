/*
You received a whatsup message from an unknown number. Could it be from that girl/boy with a foreign accent you met yesterday evening?

Write a simple function to check if the string contains the word hallo in different languages.

These are the languages of the possible people you met the night before:

hello - english
ciao - italian
salut - french
hallo - german
hola - spanish
ahoj - czech republic
czesc - polish

*/

function validateHello(greetings) {
  var greet = ["hello", "ciao", "salut", "hallo", "hola", "ahoj", "czesc"];
  greetings = greetings.toLowerCase();
  for (let i = 0; i < greet.length; i++){
    if (greetings.includes(greet[i])){
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}
