/*
You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?

Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.

If the parameter is itself not a perfect square then -1 should be returned. You may assume the parameter is non-negative.

function findNextSquare(sq) {
  // Return the next square if sq is a perfect square, -1 otherwise

 let nexNum = Math.sqrt(sq) + 1;
  if(Math.sqrt(sq) % 1 !== 0){
    return -1
  } else{
  return nexNum * nexNum
}
  }
