/*
My grandfather always predicted how old people would get, and right before he passed away he revealed his secret!

In honor of my grandfather's memory we will write a function using his formula!

Take a list of ages when each of your great-grandparent died.
Multiply each number by itself.
Add them all together.
Take the square root of the result.
Divide by two.
Example
predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) === 86
Note: the result should be rounded down to the nearest integer.
*/

function predictAge(age1,age2,age3,age4,age5,age6,age7,age8){

  let ages = [age1, age2, age3, age4, age5, age6, age7, age8]
  let multiplied = ages.map(x => x * x)
let sum = multiplied.reduce((a,c) => a + c)
let squared = Math.sqrt(sum) / 2


return Math.floor(squared)
  }
