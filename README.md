## Lessons Learned: 

I've learned that the brain is a muscle that must be exercised daily! I have been exercizing mine by solving one CodeWars kata (solution) each day to learn, evolve, and engage with the community. I learn by contributing my solutions, then learning from other developers by studying their solutions and understanding different ways to approach a specific question. Doing this daily has helped me grow as a developer, and with the endless supply of questions provided in CodeWars, there is always an initiative to improve. I  hope to pay it forward to new devs by submitting solutions of my own!
