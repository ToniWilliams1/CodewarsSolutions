/*
An array is given with palindromic and non-palindromic numbers. A palindromic number is a number that is the same from a reversed order. For example 122 is not a palindromic number, but 202 is one.

Your task is to write a function that returns an array with only 1s and 0s, where all palindromic numbers are replaced with a 1 and all non-palindromic numbers are replaced with a 0.

function convertPalindromes(numbers) {
  //CHECK IF NUM in array is palindrome
  //if it is a palindrome, turn it into a 1
  //if not turn it into a 0
  
  let res = []
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++){
if (numbers[i] == numbers[i].toString().split('').reverse().join('')){
  res.push(1)
} else {
  res.push(0)
