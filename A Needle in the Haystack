/*
Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function findNeedle () that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle".

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:
"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle.
*/ 

function findNeedle(haystack) {
  
  let position = haystack.indexOf('needle')
  
  if (haystack.includes('needle') === true) {
     return  `found the needle at position ${position}` 
  } else{
    return error
  }
  }
