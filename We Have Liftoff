/*
You have an array of numbers 1 through n (where 1 <= n <= 10). The array needs to be formatted correctly for the person reading the countdown of a spaceship launch.

Unfortunately, the person reading the countdown only knows how to read strings. After the array is sorted correctly make sure it's in a format he can understand.

Between each number should be a space and after the final number (n) should be the word 'liftoff!'
*/

function liftoff(instructions){
  //sort the array of numbers in descending order
  //turn the array back into a string, split it by " "
  //add 'lift off' to the end
  //return the string 
  
  let nums = instructions.sort((a, b) => b - a)
  
  return nums.join(' ').concat(' liftoff!')
   
}




//liftoff([6,5,4,1,2,3]) => '6 5 4 3 2 1 liftoff!'
//liftoff([4,2,1,3] => '4 3 2 1 liftoff!')
